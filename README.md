# Book Movie CRUD Application

Overview:
-This is a simple CRUD application that allows the user to create, view all, edit, and delete books and movies.

Technology Used:
-DB: The database used for this project is a PostgreSQL database.
-Backend: The backend for this project was written in Java utilizing the Spring Framework to map to the database and to manage the REST endpoints.
-Frontend: The frontend for this project was written using the Angular Framework.
-Styling: Bootstrap 5 was used for the tables, navbar, and buttons.

Issues:
-One persistent issue that I faced with this project was dealing with CORS. I added CORS annotations which helped at first but are not working anymore.

Improvements:
- One improvement is to implement the user and user login. I would like to have a registration form and use Spring Security and possibly LDAP to manage users.
- Another improvement that I want to add is beautiful homepage.
- The last improvement that I would want to add is a search capability inside the application that utilizes a movie database API like IMDB.
